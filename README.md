Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Overview:

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. A key achievement of this project is the development of an SVM model from scratch, which demonstrated a 0.4% improvement in accuracy over a pre-built SVM model from standard machine learning libraries.

Project Highlights:

Custom SVM Model: Implemented an SVM model from scratch, achieving superior performance compared to a pre-built SVM model.
• Data Preprocessing:

Applied label encoding for categorical features.
Standardized features using StandardScaler.
Addressed missing values by imputing
with the median.
Replaced inconsistent values for uniformity.

• Data Visualization: 

Explored the relationship between various services and churn, as well as gender-specific churn patterns.
Workflow:

• Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values by replacing them with the median.
Standardized text values to ensure consistency.

• Data Preprocessing:

Converted categorical features to numerical values through label encoding.
Applied StandardScaler to normalize the data.

• Data Splitting:

Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets to assess model performance.
Model Development:

• Custom SVM Model: 

Developed from scratch, with fine-tuning to maximize performance.

• Pre-built SVM Model:

Utilized a pre-built SVM model from a standard machine learning library for benchmarking.

• Model Evaluation:

Evaluated both models using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
The custom SVM model achieved a 0.4% higher accuracy compared to the pre-built model.

• Data Visualization:

Conducted detailed visual analysis of service usage and churn rates.
Analyzed churn rates by gender.
